// Assignment 2 MyTimer class
// Use this class to add a timer to your word finder program.  For some help on 
// using this class, see program TimerTest.java

// Note: There are some things (such as Threads and synchronized methods) in this
// implementation with which you may not be familiar.  However, as we discussed
// in lecture, due to data abstraction, you do not need to know these implementation
// details in order to utilize this class.  You simply need to understand what this
// class does in general, what the methods do and their headers (specifications).
// Therefore, for Assignment 2 focus on the descriptions of the methods rather than
// on the actual code within them.
